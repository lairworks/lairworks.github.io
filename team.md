        <p class="flow-text">Based out of Ohio, Leeor founded the team years ago after starting a project that later came to be known as The Legend of Mazzeroth. He is the lead developer and software engineer and can often be found tinkering with existing code bases refactoring, improving and throwing away code as needed.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">Trevor joined LairWorks in the very beginning helping Leeor to develop the project now known as The Legend of Mazzeroth. After a rough start with limited knowledge of C++ and development in general, Trevor learned the ins and outs of developing complex software and has since gone on to develop most of the OpenGL Renderer for NAS2D and much of the GUI framework used in all LairWorks games.</p>
